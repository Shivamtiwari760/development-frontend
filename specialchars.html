	<!-- now if we want there should be multiple spaces between a and sample, in html if u write too many spaces and enters those enters and spaces does not reflect page when u see them so in order to do that, if you want muliple breaks and multiple lines and similar we have to use here, in order to use wehave to use a special character called nbsp, which means no break space, the number of spaces u want u can put that time nbsp in that, have multiple nbsp characters an that will add multiple spaces, html actually ignore the raw white spaces that u write if you want to write multiple spaces u need to use the &nbsp, there are some other interesting characters as well-->
	<!-- similalarly if u want apostrophy we have &apos-->
