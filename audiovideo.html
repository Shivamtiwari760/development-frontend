<!-- in order to add the audio we have to use the audio tag with source of the audio now this is the path it can be anything either it can beelative path or the absolute path, conrol tag is used for to control the volume and and other thing os the song if u ahave a file available in multiple audio format than what u can actually use is use source tag idf in case the browser is not able to read the file than it can read the file by uisng the second source, if in case the browser is  not able to read thi mp3 file then it wil try to read the file from the second source i can say browser starts form the top and plays the first audio that it is able to read u can specify multiple too suppose u have file  that is present in multiple format and u are not sure that which format the browser will exactly so so you can use source tag for that , now in case you have vidoes you can use the video tag , if u want to provide the single source than u can use the single source or you can oprovide the multiple source than u can use the multiple source there also, by using the height and width we can fix the sixe of the video too, within opening and closing tags of video you can write some text also , the text will appear only in this case if the browser is not able to play the video tha only the content in between we can easily see, if the browser will able to play the video then the text will not be shown  here, if I want to play the youtube video I can do that as well,just explore it by yourself its there in notes in cae you are not able to do it by youw own, one moe tag that we have to discuss is figure tag, we use just figure tag to add images, different figures to a page, u can add figure tag, within fifure tag u can add the img tag, source to the image that you want to add, here one another interesting option available that is figure  caption if u want u candd the caption to the figure as well, figure tag proides u the more flexiblity even in the css also, wehn u are doing the css  you are going to play around the caption alot-->
<!-- so after media tag there are couple of more interesting  the first one is how add the favicon to your html page so what exactly the favicon is other than the tittle we have there is icon as well, adding a icon on the to ad da faicon we have to write certian piece of code to add the favicon whatever we want that is present in between the tittle tag and-->
<!-- now next thing that i want to discuss about is meta tag, now we know that html  page structure is wrtten into two broad section head and body now the reason we have head is head contains the meta data about our html page so what is meta data, meta data is the information about our html page the actual visible part false under the body section but head is also important because it contains the information about our page now there are couple of meta tags that we are going to discuss about and the reason that we are discussing about is important from the perspective of seo, now what  is seo m, seo stands for search engine opimisation, now think hat i have made a websitethat is selling the camera then now if somebody is searching for the camera on search engine lets say google so I want that the person would land on my website as well
so in order to do that my website would rank on the top
because  most of the people visit the top result that  they will get at the top, they generally visit the first page only they dont visit the 2nd or third page generally, its very imporant that uir websiote will land on the top of the resluts of the query, so this is basically the search engine optimisation so that by making the maximum ranking of your website most people will visit your website so the mrat tags which are important from the search engine optimisation purpose is
the first tag is desrciption tag, now in order to use that u have to use the meta adn under name u have to specify the description now next u have to specify the content now within this content u have to specify the  brief what is website is about so this content is genrally 2 to 3 lines it wont contain the paragraph
it is hort description or short brief about your website
now this is the only content that is used for the website in ordr to search and to figure out about your website
there is another meta tag that is keywordssee whatever the query peron type some keyword out of the query are extracted and the search in a happens on the basis of keyword, if the person is searching for thr keyword that u have offer than
the tags that are considered genrallly from the search engine perspective so the search engine algorithm is not revealed yet so you can not exactly figure out what keyword is important or not but some tags are imporant from the point of search engine optimisation
so we have discussed the description or we have discussed the keywords and tittle of the page is also considered important so make sure that u have relevant words in the tittle genraly the heading on the page is also considered as important
another tag that we want to discusss about is the author tag generally so in case so in caSE YOU want to add the author of the page you can do that as well there are many author tag which you can read about-->
