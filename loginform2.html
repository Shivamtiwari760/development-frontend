<!-- another one thing that we can do is time, yiu just hae to chnage the time in place of the number , and then u can enter the time there-->
<!-- one other thing that we  can take is the email as the input, as only you have to replace the value in the inpit section from number to email and the things will be done, it will valodate the fomat of the email by adding the character and number as well as host name too like @ and yahoo and all-->
<!-- you can also write down the url in the input in place of the number and any of the input you have given previously, which would obey the http and www and website name and all-->

<!-- forms are basically used for the collection of data, whether it is a signup form, login form and contact form anything it can be used for the collcting the data, now after collecting what should be the next step, now whatever data you have collected you should pass it further, now form has to collect the data and pass it for that means as there is some particular format, in which form will be passing the data further-->
<!-- here we have two things name and value, name  of the filed and value of the field, value of the field is whatever t the data user has enter and name of the field is name is something that we need to specify, if someone wants to use the data you should know the name of the field, if I want to extract out of the data , javascript and any other you shoul know name odf the data, if i wnat to extract the data like what was the name of the country, and corresponding to that name i'll get that value, so ths is why the naming is very important, so that means every filed that you create, every input field you have it should have name, because form will not otherwise pass the data further so inorder to add name you need name attriute, you  have to specify the name attribute that you are using, value is the default value that you can give that like you want county be to befault set as india then in value tag we can use the india and we will get the answer for what we are lokking for,we have to se the name which is pretty much important, in many forms u wil see there are some filds which are disable, may be some data which is already filled in , like name is laready filled in, if there are some details which are already filled in, and u actuallly dont want to somebody to edit them in the form then u can, marks that field as disable, if u are writing diabled that means its avlue is true, if u skip disabled here that means the value is false, name value and disabled are the attibute which are very important as name is the attribute by which in futuree if we areusing the same code in javascript then we have to give the name to this so that it can specify the value of it, and after that the disabled function is used so that we cant chnage the value and we also cant use the that name in any other place in the form-->
