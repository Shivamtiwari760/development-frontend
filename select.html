<!-- select tag is used in case of the drop down list, YOU HAVE TO USE THE OPTION  tag to be thier like if u serach for months then in option there are all months are available, there is one importnat attribute that we have missed here is name attribute we have to use in the select attribute, because the form has to send the forward data to the some page may be the data that the form forward is in the form of name and value, because if an tag is missing the name attribute than its data will not be forwarded, whatever the month will select that will be forwarded now by using the name attribute, if u want to select any month defaut then u can use the selected attribute it is a boolean attribute so no need to specify it, the driop down list we have now we can actually one option among all we have, in order to allow multiple selection, you can add a multiple attribute here, and multiple attribute is again a boolean attribute, just add the multiple attribute to the select tag, how can u select multiple is just press control if u are using the windows and select whatever option you want to, select tag option, multiple required
the next tag is related to textual information, so if u have to take some input in textual information we already have one that was type text, input type text write, now the problem with input type text is that it only take single line input, but in most of the cases we wanted to take more than one line of textual line input for example if u want to your user to share your experience, or write a product review or add a comment may be or describe yourself so whether the input will be multile line, for multiple line  we van use te text area attriute for multiple line, you can control the dimensions of textwork, you canspexcify the number of rows and number of columns to manage the dimensions of textarea, the last tag that we want to discuss is how to add buttons, we have already learn how to add the one button and that was the submit button right, but what if I want to add the couple of more buttons, that do not perform the submit operation but the previous and next type operation, we can use the input type button inplace of submit ,you can see the button but that is next to the text area, the reason is text area is the inline and we have to add the break , there is no text in the button because we have not added any text in it, we can add the text bys using the value tag, now there is another way to add the button is by using the button tag actually like <button></button>, now its very important to specify the type here so the button tag authenticate three values for type attribute
1st is the submit which is the default value as well, and next is the normal button that u can specify by using the button, the third button is the reset button the purpose of this button to reset all the values of form, the text of the button is specify in the opening and closing button of the tag like ex button2, there is only one thing different  that we can do by using the button tag, now I can also add the image to my button, the text of the button we have already added previously but we can dd the images too, that is something that we can do by sing the input tag, but we can do it by suing the button tag here, u can also se the height and width of the image that u have taken in your button, in this session we have learnt how to add the drop down list adn we are able to do it by using the select tag, we have used the option tag to add options and multiple tag also making the field as default selected value ow after the select tag we learn about the text area to take multiple line inputs and the last thing we discuss is buttons.
so till now we ghev discussed about too many things about forms and relevant types of forms different types of inputs and the elements that the form can have, there is one important thing that we have no discussed about forms about yet is we know the purpose of the form is to collect data and then pass the data now pass on the data too is something that we have not discussed yet so where the form send the data we can do that by using the axction attribute so where the form has to send the data whatever data it has collected we need to speciy the url of that page here o which the data the form is sending we ae going to specify the url here, obvisly for the url we have some backend data is with us,we just need to specify the url here , there is one important attribute related to form is that is method, we have to specify the http data that we want to use, so lets undertsnd it in brief so suppose u have a browser where u have a webpage, now this browser wants to communicate with the server, sever is basically the machine where all logic runs so whatever he data the form is collecting that has been send to the page now that page lets say hosted on a server browser/client has too send data, the request that we use for the is http that iis hyper text transfer protocol, there are  different type of http request, the two are one of most important and that are get and post request, so ge and post are two important http request,form has collected some data and how it has to send this data and make the request after that after that server will do response, method attribute can take two values either get or post
method="get" or method="post", now get request are genrally made when we want to get back retrieve some information from the server so we are sending the data so the main purpose is we are requesting some information from the server so in that case we use the get request we dont want server to  make change in its database we just want server to give some informationto us in that case so we use get request b now post request are generally made when u are sending some data to the server and you want server to be either save it create some data around it and update an existing entry  with it post request is used when u want to send some data to the server and you want that server should do some change in this data so this is what post request for now there is  another diffrenece between get and post and let just understand that while performing the data that we are entering in the text area that area is going to be add in the url after selecting the method as get , so this method is not secure this is easily visible to anybody so if you wnat the information like password then  get is no the preferred type for it ebcause we dont wnat to reveal the password in the url so in that case we use the post
so after selecting the post whatever data that we aadding in the etxt area is not gonna appear in the url
you can easily see that by inspecting the page option by clicking on the right click you will get the option inspect and in that u can view that, so that data is atleast hidden and it is not directly visible so post request are relatively most secure in comparison to get
what get do the it reveals the information in the url
if the information is not really necessar then we can use the get if the infomation like passwords than u have to use the post we here learn about two attributes action and method in cation we specify the url of the page to which form has to send the data to and under method we specify like which http method we are using
so two http method which are relevant from the perspective of form are get and post-->
