	<!-- div is used to structure the code better it looks like good, it define content to be a block level, divs are pretty much handy in structuring the code-->
<!-- header -->
<!-- semantic words meaning is basically, semantic tags are more meaningfull tags and they dont offer any unique functionality but they do  make a more familiar for us
	there is navigation tag is used for semantic tag generally navigation tag, now the navigated elements are placed in the nav element,and we can use semantic header tag is here we can use use navigation tag by using this 
	<nav> and </nav> and and header tag by using the navigation is ny lke this <header> </header>, this header clears that this part is belong to the header of the page, and next we have content of the page for that we have semantic tag called main, <main> and </main>, there is  a semantic tag for footer as well <footer> </footer>
	semantic tags are similar to divs actaually u can think of them simlilar to divs, containers for multiple elements together its just that there means are more meaningfull and closely related to the purpose that we are using in it-->

<!--image <img> tag in that this img tag is te single tag that means there is no closing html tag that u have to specify so need to add a closing tag its is juts a tag we have to specigy like what image we have to take  here source is the attribut so, the valuse of the source is the value of url that we want to display-->

alt="how to become full stack web developer">
<!-- image img tag is a singular tag so  no closibg tag after the iamge tag u can specify the path you link via the sourse attribute relative or absoulute path whatever it is it will work, there was a alt attribute used to specify a description around the image and then there are height and width that can be written in pixels and in percentage
<!-- you can also specify height and width by using the % like 50% it means it will present in the screen by 50% of the paret width matlab pures screen par 50% aayega yh, setting in the persentage is the good idea because it will decide and open according to the screen size-->
 <!-- the usnit is pixesls even we can wite it also like 200px-->
<!-- we secify the absolute path with resepect to the root folder and relative path is respect to the current folder-->
<!-- alt atrribute is use for the display the text that we want to show incase we are not able to load the image-->
<!-- we can  specify the dimension of the image by using the height and width properties-->

<!-- one thing that we should note here is that we have set attribute for this p tag so that so the style attribute is actually makn the chnages in this p only all other paragraph in the html are not impacted by the change, if i have to make all the paragraphs tag blue may be so I have to addd the style attribute for each of the paragraph now, there is one  another property that is font size so we want to chnage the size of the text so, here px stands for pixel , px here stands for the css pixel, on egood thing is good in css that property having same functions as thier use cases, we no need to memorise it by the usage only we will be able to find which one I have to use at which place, we genrally call it the inline css to the page, style tag is the another head like by using this we can acheive the same , if I want so set the default syle for all the paragraph then  style we have to use in the head for using it for all the paragraphs and styla attribute only wor for a particular elements in which the attribute was added too but in this way I have applied the style to a complete tag and not just occurence of one tag so all the p tags in my page will turn blue
now external css means that move all the rules move all the styling part outside in the file in the seperate css file-->
<!-- the css rule is to convert the lower case into the upper case is text-transform it is the css rule actually  if I want to aplly this rule to h4 headin so -->
<!-- so text transform If I have to aplly all the thing in the lowercase then also we can do w that by using the text-transfrom lowercase so ,here we can do both of them lowercase and uppercase-->
<!-- if I want to change the h4 into uppercase and lowercase and we want  the various h4 heading thet are aslo present in  my code would not be affected so in this case we can use the css class we can do this w have to use like by using the dot and then the classname and after that-->
<!-- I actually want the h1 heading of the first list which is te part of firts list actually should be bold but if there are h1 headinh in the other list , or h4 heading else where in my code they should not be affected i want to apply the css rule and ap  ply to the bunch of elements not applied to every occurence of h1, you can actually achieve this using class we have to use the . (dot) it is the just syntax and the the , id is genrally used when u specify the particular element-->
