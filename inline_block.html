<!-- now one thing to notice that the h tag we are using is the block tag,block means that they start in new line although the heading 1 as content wise as notable to occupying the I should say space, complete width available to it, but it is blocking the complete line, and the heading 2 is begining from the next line actaullly the and they occupy the complete width available to them that means if  u are using a block html tag, that means that blog tag always start in newline and they occupy the complete space 
	some other block tags that we have learnt about is
	p tag, so here the paragraph is begining in the next line that means, and another block level tag is div, so the second div will start in next line not in the same line-->
	<!-- inline tag are the tags that they dont start a new line, they take asa much space is for thier content, and they dont block the complete line for you-->
	<!-- there is a third block also we call it as inline block that we will lern about them when we will learn css-->
