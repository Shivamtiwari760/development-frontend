	<!-- inorder to made this paragraph bold we can use the <b> and </b> tag by  using this way, this will do the sample bold , using this way, here the thing is noted that the b is the inline tag not the block tag, its juts take as much as width is required for it purpose for its content no newline stuff-->
	<!-- for italic tag we can easily use the <i> </i> tag, you can make the next bold and italic at the same time, just surround with both b and i-->
	<!-- we have another tag strong , bold and strong have the same function but we use strong for an important thing-->
	<!-- if u want to add subscripts you can do that like we want to wrtite square of a than we use superscript-->
	<!-- and if u want subscript may be then u can do that-->
	<!-- sup and sub are the superscript and subscript, waht we have learnt about till now is bold, italics,superscript and subscript, strong and  if u want to add quotations, then u can use the q tag for that-->
	<!-- in some lectures before we have used how to use the div tag, div tag is basically it is  continer similary we have span , yhe difference between div and span is that span is a inline tag that is not goint ot start in new line or notoccupying the complete width , so if you want to group elements together apply common styles and common formatting in  that u can do it by using span
		group them all together-->
		<!-- by using the span u can group elements together if you want to apply common styling to them so we can use that-->
