	 here we are going to use the inline css in this section so keep it as a backup for learning all these stuff and keepm updated urself so that u will be able to do that what you are thinking about</P>
	 <!--inline css affect the tag only the which one in which u have applied this is the attribute so that it will be only applied to the current p tag the other then this p tag is not gonna affected by that inline css will win if we wanna apply the inline css and internal css for all so that for particular we have applied the inline css is remain same as we have applied the inline css for theat individually so that the internal css is  not going to affect this-->
	 <P> in this paragrapgh we are ging to see the internal css so keep this notes ready for u whenever u need to learn and do any revision so go through that and learn the projects also by yourself and dont depend on other people keep updated yourself follow he self discipline and dont do bad things keep increaeing the working hours just by simple pomodoro techniue and do development atleast 4 hours per day this will boost your power and definitely one fine day you will be able to grab the best offer in bangalore so dont look for any one do work hard by urself, the text written inside the head and tittle tag is internal css which will work for the every one untill unless  have applied the inline css for a seperate paragrapgh its going to be work now</P>

<!-- so to link the external css we need the link tag filename  and by using the link we can use the externall css by making the seperate file of it-->
<!-- here we have the for a particular paragrapgh we have external css which told that the color should be orange and the internal ss told that the clor should be blue and the inline css will told for the color should be red so for sure the inline css will win in the first paragrapgh to which it specified that it will gonna be red-->
<!-- if inline css was not there only external and internall css is there so now we have to see out of these rule which rule is gonna finally apply, here the interal css rule is going to dominate that has been applied, we cant conclude that external css will not win always so currently link tag is first and then style tag is there so now if u see the color of other paragraph is orange now it does not mean that external css and internal css will always win there are multiple rules so the last rule is applied to the css tag, we apply from top to bottom then the color of the p tag will depend upon the last tag-->
<!-- if I wil reverse the state ment of internal and external css then the last one from the top to botton will be applied always the last case is going to be applicable in the css that u ahve to keep in mind-->
